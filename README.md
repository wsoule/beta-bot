# Beta Bot
working on this bot to expand my experience

## What have I learned?
Working on this bot has greatly expanded my experience using typescript and Node.js. This discord bot is almost 100% back-end work, which I have done very little of, so building this bot has helped me experience what some of the difficulties of back-end development is like. Within this bot there is command and event handling, interactions, and working with external APIs.
